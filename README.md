# Advent of Code 2022

My attempt at the Advent of Code 2022

https://adventofcode.com

This attempt is making use of google's [Rust evaluation context](https://github.com/google/evcxr) in order to build a jupyter notebook with a Rust kernel.
I have then built this into a nix flake in order to have a reproducable development environment.
